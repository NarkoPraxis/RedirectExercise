# RedirectExercise

------------------------------------------
There are two ways this class can be used:
------------------------------------------ 
	-> First, through the interface method defined by the exercise. 
	   Pass in the input as defined by the examples and the expected output will be returned. 

	-> Second, it is also possible to call the MapPath function directly and build the graph with that function, 
	   never needing to call process, then call TraverseGraph when the whole output is required.
